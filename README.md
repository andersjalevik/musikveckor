# To run scraper

1. Get an token at https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlist
2. Create an .env with SPOTIFY_TOKEN = [your token here]
3. Run node index.js which will generate songs.json and songs.csv
4. Open songs.csv in numbers or google sheets and marvel at our collective effort!

# To do:

- Error handling
- Append new blogs instead of generating from scratch
- Maybe som FE to sort, filter and get some statistics? Or maybe just use google sheets?
